5. If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you will choose as your partner and why?

-> If I need to start one software company, I would see only people with skills and expirience(is possible). 
Marks never will be a criteria for me to select any person for my company. I have these two super skilled friends 
i.e Everly Precia(a great developer) and Amaan Afif(a data analyst with good amount of experience). 
They both are very well skilled in their work. And as they both belong to two different fields, it would
be better to scale in all the directions.
